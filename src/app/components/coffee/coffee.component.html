            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the
            seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. When coffee berries
            turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they
            are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as
            "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired
            flavor.
