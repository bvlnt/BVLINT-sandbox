# ABOUT
This project is to study Angular and TailwindCSS with modern UI/UX ideas.
The components are mainly inspired by @Hyperlexed on YouTube. The goal on some components was to translate his reverse engineered components from plain HTML/CSS/JS to Angular and TailwindCSS. 
Scrolling through Awwwards' Site Of The Day was also inspirational.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.
